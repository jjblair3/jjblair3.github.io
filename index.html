                <p>Hello class, my name is John Blair and I am a Graphic Information Technology student at Arizona State University. I transferred from Mesa Community College and began my ASU experience in the summer of 2020. I'm extremely excited to start this journey and I hope things will start to get back to normal so I can immerse myself into the full college experience.  </p>

                    <p>Allow me to introduce the most important people in my life: starting from the top left going clockwise, Zoey and Bear, next is my girlfriend, Shelby. We'll continue to the cutie in the hat, Hooch, and finally Peanut.</p>

                    <h1>BASKETBALL</h1>
                    <p>I'm a huge basketball fan. My favorite team growing up is the Los Angeles Clippers. While the Clippers are my preferred team I enjoy watching any of the NBA teams play, I'm not too into NCAA, but now that I'm an ASU student I was <em>hoping</em> to go to some games. When the gyms aren't closed, I also like to play!</p>

                    <h1>PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
                    <p>I don't bring my camera everywhere with me, but if I'm going somewhere outside of the Phoenix light pollution I love capturing the stars. I've taken a ton of star pictures and star trails, my next goal is to get a wider lens to hopefully capture the Milky Way!</p>
